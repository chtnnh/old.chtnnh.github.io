So I reached home around 08:30 PM today.

_You would think that a country that has been blessed with rains for millenia would know how to function when it pours from the sky._

But the universe is a deterministic system where everything happens for a reason. Or at least, that's what I believe right now.

So when I reached home, I went straight to the terrace, where I made some friends over a couple cigarettes. For now, that's enough. Just having a conversation that I enjoy, is enough to make me classify a day as good.

Today was a good day, see you tomorrow.
