There is not much to say, the title should be self-explanatory. In case it isn't though, this is the start of something new. This is the start of something exciting.

The reasons are quite straightforward:
1. I am moving to a different country, on my own
2. I am starting my first "real" job
3. I am going to be "adulting"

Now, under normal circumstances, the _three_ reasons above would be plenty, but since these are not normal circumstances, there is something more to add.

### It's the beginning of my _"Build in Public"_ phase in life.

1. Put simply, as human beings, the greatest projects we work on in our lives, is ourselves.
2. Whatever work I've done on this project (me) so far has been sporadic, unstructured, involuntary and private.

It's about time I took matters into my own hands, and if I've learned anything about hostile takeovers, it's that they have to be dramatic.

Hence, on a very serious note, I must say the following.

### Thank you for everything, I will take it from here.

Of course, this will all seem foolish, sooner or later. But that's the point of the _Build in Public_ phase, it's proof that you were where you were and you figured your own way out. More importantly, it helps the people after you.

<br />

That's about what I have to say, for now. Welcome to my build in public phase. Details will follow soon.
