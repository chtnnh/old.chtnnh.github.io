First day on my first job. _Very_ exciting!

But if I'm being honest, today has been a mixed bag. Bangalore hasn't shown me everything yet, but I'm starting to realize not everything is as easy as it seems from afar.

I made a friend yesterday, we vibed almost instantly. I feel really lucky to have actually made a friend. But I would be lying if I said that it's all good.

#### There is a certain loneliness inside of me that I just can't shake off.

The worst part is, I don't know where this is coming from.

I had a great day at the office. My team is very supportive, very nice, very genuine. But it almost feels like I'm scared of being in a room alone.

I am sitting with the friend I made yesterday right now, because this feeling was getting too much. The irony is, I hate myself for imposing on her, but I am just so scared of being trapped in that room with nothing to do, nobody to call and nothing to fill this void.

I'm sorry this post took such a drastic turn from the previous few, but this is just me being honest.

It's getting harder for me to type without crying, so I think I should stop.

I'll see you tomorrow.
