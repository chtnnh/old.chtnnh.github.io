Sometimes you forget to do your laundry, simply because you've not really had to in a long time. That was probably what happened to me this weekend.

I realized I needed to, so I did. It was mundane.

_Sometimes though, the mundane tasks give us time to reflect on what we have been putting off for a while_.

I have been in BLR for 10 days now. I cannot believe how quick these days have passed. If you have been reading along, you would probably agree with me when I say that not all of these days were as quick as I wished.

#### Loneliness, I believe, is the worst pain to exist.

Maybe I'm biased, maybe not. But I don't think anyone can deny that feeling alone in such a huge universe must be a different kind of hurt.

The universe is infinite, and that means there are infinite versions of me. There are also infinite "people" who know exactly what I'm feeling right now. Yet, living on a planet with 8,000,000,000 people and not having even _one_ who knows you is what allows mere mortals like myself to write words that might last forever.

Not to say that I'm there by any means. But a friend told me today that my words made her feel more understood than she ever felt in her life.

_I don't know how to feel about that._

#### All I feel like though, is an impostor.

Is everything in my life a hyperbole?

Maybe I will find out.
