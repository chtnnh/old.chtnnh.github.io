A lot of people have heard me say that words are all I have. I'm not sure how much they believe it, but I know for a fact that they don't believe it as much as I do.

_But even though words are all I have, they almost never fail to betray me._

It's not that they have the wrong intentions. It's just that they can't do better. No matter how hard I try, my words will never be able to capture _every aspect_ of what I am trying to convey.

This is not me saying that I don't try, nor is it me saying that I will not try. All it means is that, there is no version of this universe where people can understand each other perfectly.

I think there was a slight (mis)communication between me and the people around me today. It's okay, nothing major.

#### Most life-altering events aren't major things, they are just the accumulated changes from millions of "nothing major" things.

Don't worry too much, I am just reflecting on what I think happened today. _These words are not sad, they are just a representation of the blank expression most of us have when we are lost in our own thoughts._

That's perfectly fine by the way, this blank expression. It is what helps us know when the highs and lows are upon us.

All right then, see you tomorrow.
