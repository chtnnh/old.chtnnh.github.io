Not going to lie, I am slightly drunk right now. The only reason this is slight is because I barfed and embarrassed the friend I was out drinking with.

_I feel like shit_.

The atmosphere changed the moment it happened. She spent the next 30 minutes trying to convince me it wasn't as bad as I thought it was.

I'm not sure why she came with me either. She spoke in a language I wasn't familiar with, but she messaged one of her friends saying something along the lines of "I came with him so that he pays the bill".

#### I feel too helpless to think that I wouldn't have gone if I had known that before.

I'm hurt, more so than I can explain. Explaining my hurt is irrelevant either way, because you don't care.

For now, I guess this is it. See you tomorrow.
