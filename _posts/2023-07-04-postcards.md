I have a friend halfway across the world. I asked her to send me a postcard from the country she's helping people in (she's volunteering there).

This is _not_ the postcard she sent, but I'm sure you figured that out because it's blank.

#### What it is however, is a postcard I bought for myself.

To commemorate this city, this adventure that has just begun for me. It is exhilirating but also scary. It is full of it's own highs and lows.

I have realized something since yesterday.

#### Human connection is the second most important thing in the world, right after how well you can spend time alone.

This city will change me forever. _It is my job to ensure that the change is positive_.

I think I'm off to a great start.
