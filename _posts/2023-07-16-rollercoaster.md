About now marks the end of my third weekend and second week in BLR. _Overall, these two weeks have been quite the rollercoaster ride._

#### It's about time I step off this rollercoaster and get on something _much_ more stable.

A few things I have noticed in the past couple days since I last wrote here:
1. What might seem like bravery to an outsider, might just be desperation to the actor. Or so I feel about the things I do.
2. I still have a _long_ way to go on the road to being at peace with myself.
3. The only person you can expect things from is yourself. People get busy, life happens. You need to learn to be the first one you turn to.
4. Like every high is followed by a low, every low must also be followed with a high. Sometimes that's all you need to remember.
5. This one I have known for a long time, but was reminded of recently - _people are much, much more complex than you might realize._

There is always a time for everything. I would like to believe that the past two weeks were time for this rollercoaster. But for now, I think I am done with that.

Only time will tell, of course, but having a vague idea of what you want or need in the present moment is so much better than having none.

So how do I plan to bring back a semblance of stability in my life? Like all unnecessarily complexly worded questions, this one too has a simple answer.

#### Routine.

Let's see how well that goes. See you tomorrow though, friend.
