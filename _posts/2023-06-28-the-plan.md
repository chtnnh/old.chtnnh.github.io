Hello again! This is installment two of the _Build in Public_ phase blog series. Today wasn't very productive, which is acceptable because I am flying out tomorrow night and am slightly preoccupied with guests today.

What I'm trying to figure out at the moment though, is whether or not I want to burn every relic from my past and watch them all perish. Sounds extreme, and that is intentional. The past hasn't been my proudest time, I have made my fair share of irretriable blunders. It pains me to think of them today.

_Is this the nature of being? Are we to shrivel at the mention of our pasts because of their flaws?_

I sincerely hope not.

What essentially is the plan anyway?

There is not much of a plan, if I'm being honest. I'm landing in BLR 2 days from now. There won't be many reminders of my past there. But let's be honest, today, we spend more of our time in our digital shelters than our homes.

With that in mind, I reset my laptop. It caused quite a bit of inconvenience setting it up again. But yeah here we are.

This is a fresh start.
