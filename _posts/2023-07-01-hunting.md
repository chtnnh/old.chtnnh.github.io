It is the 1st of July, 2023 and I am sitting in Loay's room in BLR. He's an old friend of mine, and is also the best (his words, not mine). I spent a considerable amount of today roaming around Indiranagar, _apartment hunting_.

The realizations I had yesterday, about living in the present moment, have been more than helpful. I found myself on the back seat of the bike, just enjoying the wind in my hair, watching the majestic trees lining the roads, living it up.

Not to say that I wasn't concerned about the future, _I was just not anxious about it_.

#### I was doing what needed to be done, in the present moment. It was nothing short of freeing.

Found a place, booked it, will move in tomorrow. For now, I'm going to rest up. Not to mention catch up with some old friends xD
